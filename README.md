# C195Project

This project utilized a VM provided by Western Governors University.
There is no access to the SQL database provided by the school. As such, the program is non-functional due to the lack of access.

When access was available, this program allowed a user to log-in, add/remove appointments and clients, edit the same, and delete the same. Error tracking made sure that 
a non-valid user could not enter the program. A user could update the SQL database entirely from this program.

Additionally, the program would check log-in attempts and would show the user's machine time on the log-in display.
